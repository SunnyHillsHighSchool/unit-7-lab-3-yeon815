# Unit-7-Lab-3
Lab Goal :   This lab was designed to introduce and demonstrate how to use an ArrayList.  

Lab Description :   Create a method that will receive an integer parameter and then return an ArrayList that contains all of the numberâ€™s factors, excluding 1 and itself.  Create a 2nd method that will remove all numbers from its ArrayList parameter that are not composite numbers.  Composite numbers are divisible by 1, itself, and must have at least 1 other positive factor.  You will need to use % to determine if a number is a factor.

public class ArrayListFunHouse
{

  public static ArrayList<Integer> getListOfFactors(int number)
  {	
	// you will add code	
  }

  public static void keepOnlyCompositeNumbers( List<Integer> nums )
  {
      // you will add code	
  }

}
